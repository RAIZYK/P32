            William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet,
            playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language
            and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the
            "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately
            39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of
            uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language
            and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age
            of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and
            twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful
            career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the
            Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he
            appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of
            Shakespeare's private life survive, this has stimulated considerable speculation about
            such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and
            whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often
            criticized for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners
            of his period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early
            plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best
            work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among
            them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest
            works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies
            (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and
            accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of
            Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text
            known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic
            works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem
            by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare as "not of an age, but
            for all time".
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually
            adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His
            plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various
            cultural and political contexts around the world.
