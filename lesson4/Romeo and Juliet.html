    <h3 style="font-family: Arial; color: #929ead">ACT 1</h3>
    <h2 style="font-family: Arial; color: #929ead">PROLOGUE</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;  ">Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life,<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage,<br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family: Arial; color: #929ead">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic";>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Arial; color: #929ead">SAMPSON</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Arial; color: #929ead;">GREGORY</h3>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers</p>
